Why numpy (numerical python)
    - Written in C, super fast (wayyyyyy faster than lists)!
    - performs vectorization via broadcasting (avoiding loops!) So Fast!

    * Machine Learning is converting data to numbers and then finds patterns within those numbers
    * NumPy is the backbone of most data science in python
